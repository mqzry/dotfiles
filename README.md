# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles with a small bootstrap script to link it.

## Branching model

For every context(Work vs Personal/ macOS vs Arch) there is a branch.
These will be the long lasting branches. Whenever I need a special combination, there will be an ad-hoc merged branch.
For example Work+Arch.

### TODO

* date args in todo/config are different in macOS then arch. Only done macOS version on master
* PATH element adjusted for macOS with /usr/local/bin in master
* add list of brew packages to macOS branch
* add gitconfig
* TODO moving should go further back in history if it can not find a todo for yesterday

## Supports

* bash
* X11
* vim

* haskell
* gpg
* ssh
